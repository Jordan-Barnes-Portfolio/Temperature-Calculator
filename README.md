# TemperatureCalculator
converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit after taking data from a text document.

This program was particularly interesting because it taught me the basics of utilizing line by line data interpretation with CPP from an outside document.
There are many available points of improvement on this program.  Pop out menu with interactable buttons and sleek UI.  Allowing the history of temperatures to be recorded etc.
Several hurdles occured while developing this particular program.  Namely utilizing the IO streams to process text from a document.  This was solved by simply rereading my textbook and activities from the current lesson and using critical analysis to solve any error messages I recieved. 
After solving any and all errors that occurred while in development I learned a couple valuable skills.  Problem solving and code syntax analysis was the most important.  Proof reading and learning to correct syntax errors immediately was a life saver.
I learned to make the code very readable by using proper indentation and spacing as well as adaptable by making it very modularized and clear.  I added in line comments so every step was made clear to the reader.
